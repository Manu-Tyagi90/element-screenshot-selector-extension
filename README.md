## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **iframes & Shadow DOM:**  
  Elements inside iframes or shadow DOM may not be captured due to browser security restrictions.
- **Complex Sites:**  
  Some highly dynamic or protected sites (like Google.com) may not allow capturing certain elements.
- **Full Page Capture:**  
  This extension captures individual elements, not the entire page. For full-page screenshots, use Chrome‚Äôs built-in screenshot tool or another extension.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How It Works

- When you click the extension icon, it injects `html2canvas` and a custom script into the current tab.
- The script highlights elements on hover and listens for your click.
- On click, it uses `html2canvas` to render the selected element as a canvas, then saves it as a PNG.
- A floating info box provides feedback throughout the process.
